THM - Snort

Using SNORT, network admins can spot denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) attacks, buffer overflows,
and stealth port scans. SNORT creates a series of rules that define malicious network activity, identify malicious packets, and send alerts to users.
 
Intrusion Detection System: An IDS is designed to detect a potential incident, generate an alert, and do nothing to prevent the incident from occurring. 

Intrusion Prevention System: An IPS, on the other hand, is designed to take action to block anything that it believes to be a threat to the protected system.
