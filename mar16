KEYBASE!

"Keybase is a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys in a publicly auditable manner.
Additionally it offers an end-to-end encrypted chat and cloud storage system, called Keybase Chat and the Keybase Filesystem respectively."

It has about 500,000 users world wide, and was created by Max Krohn in 2014

Keybase was acquired by Zoom in 2020 to further strengthen video communications 

While using keybase, you're able to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify. 

When encrypting, you can send someone a cipher text that uses saltpack and if they're not on keybase yet, it'll provide them info to get keybase, prove who they are, and view the message.

You can also decrypt messages from other keybase users

I like how you and sign your messages with your cryptographic signature and verify ones as well
