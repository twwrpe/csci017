The Cabir Virus is the first known virus to affect mobile devices 

It used bluetooth to multiple 

The Cabir virus affected the Symbian operating system

Whenever the Cabir virus affected a device it would display the message "Caribe"

"The worm was created and sent out by researchers as a PoC (Proof of Concept), they did not believe that the mobile operating system could be easily exploited. Since then, malicious programs have become more popular."

I started up a VM and examined a potentially dangerous file "TWFsd2FyZQ.apk"

It was listed a .apk file, which is the the type for mobile devices 

I was able to determine that it's not a complex malware file and it targets android systems 

When completing the 'digging deeper' section I learned about virustotal website where we can analyze the file quite a bit more

I learned that it's a malicious sofware and there's parts ofit that allows the camera to take photos by the malware

When we use MobSF we can look even further to find out this is made by java, and it's a medium risk malware that's attacks janus 

After finishing this room I learned that researching is your bestfriend, and MOBSF is such a helpful tool!
