THM - investigate windows

This week I didn't have much of a write up or a guide per-say. 

It was a straight forwad room, that didn't need too much guidance. 

I've learned a lot this semester and I'm thankful to have taken this final course with you.

I hope that being back in the corporate world gives you happiness!

Thanks for being an awesome instructor this semester :)
